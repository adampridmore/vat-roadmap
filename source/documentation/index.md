# VAT (MTD) Roadmap

We produce this roadmap to give you a high level view of our current and planned API services for VAT (MTD).

## What this Roadmap tells you

This roadmap sets out the frontend APIs currently available in both our ‘Live’ and ‘Test’ environments, and our anticipated schedule for future API releases.

It provides details of releases relating to the service delivered via other mechanisms, such as a User Interface.

## What is the ‘backend’ functionality

This is the functionality developed in HMRC which allows API endpoints to be integrated into your software to call up a customer’s information (or update a customer’s record) required to complete certain transactions.

This could include, verifying a customer’s details, in which case a request would be sent to HMRC and our ‘backend’ function would check whether the Customers information is correct. This would also be the way customers would send HMRC their updates, through the frontend API in your software, to the backend function in HMRC which would update their records.

## When will the backend functionality be available?

The ‘backend’ functionality is being developed in parallel with the frontend APIs and their end points. We show on this roadmap when frontend APIs will be available in ‘Test’ or ‘Live’ that can connect to backend functionality.

## What is “controlled go live”?

Before releasing functionality to all our customers we will conduct testing on it with limited customer numbers. This period is referred to as “controlled go live” or private beta.

## Who we are

We are the Software Developer Collaboration Team (SDST) made up of two teams.

Our **Software Developer Support Team** (SDST) provides technical information and support to third party software developers including producing this roadmap.

Our **Digital Relationship Management** (DRM) team provides dedicated account management to developers and developer representative bodies.
